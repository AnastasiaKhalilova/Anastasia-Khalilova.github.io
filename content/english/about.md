# Where I am Studying
By taking the Research Biology course created by C-Moor and offered at Clovis Community College as a senior high school enrichment student, I was introduced to the field of data science and research in biology using data science analysis, software, and databases. I'll be continuing my studies in the fields of science as an undergrate at the California Institute for Technology whilst pursuing a degree in geobiology and planetary sciences. 
# Why?
Data science has introduced me to an entirely new realm of analyzing informaiton, data, and using this in research to answer research questions and better understand how the world around us works. I hope to further my research in comparing gene orthologs in plant and animal organisms and their shared roles in biological processes to better understand formation, processes, and deterioration of information processing systems in organisms such as root systems and nervous systems, so that such information and resarch can be used and applied in the fields of medicine, plant biology, and nerosciences.
# Research and Project Interests
* Comparitive genomics
* Plant biology and mycology
* Planetary sciences and astrobiology
* Comparative biology in root systems and nervous systems using a single-RNA sequencing dataset for Arabidopsis and a neuralation dataset in mice
* Studying defective genes resulting in root system deteroiration and misformation and neurodegenerative diseases
* Gene expression of plant roots and leaves when exposed to environmental factors present in extraterrestrial, lunar, martian, and microgravity environments
